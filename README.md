# Free Twitter (X) Followers App

## Features
- **Easy to Use**: Run the app with just your Twitter (X) username.
- **Daily Limit**: Ensures fair usage among all users.


## Prerequisites
Before you run the application, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
